N8N BASED "FLOWPROGRAMMING"

These days one might want to ask LLM how a system of AI agents could help me automate my work?

The core idea is to build AI agents that replicate you in repetitive, manual tasks—dramatically improving productivity.
When the use case is simple and scalable, this can be a powerful solution. These systems function similarly to 
Simulink or Unreal Blueprints, but for workflows—using APIs, HTTP GET/POST requests, and JSON data formats.
A tool like Perplexium (if available as a node) may be useful in certain specialized tasks.

Three key components of an agent system:

I.) LLM – for reasoning and decision-making

II.) Memory – to retain and use context over time

III.) Tools – to take action (e.g., APIs, databases, email, etc.)

Bottom line: It saves time and money. However, the overall Use Case should be
rather small in order to avoid debugging disasters (hell).
