Overview

Prompt engineering is kind of like alchemy. There's no clear way to predict what will work best. 
It's all about experimenting until you find the right prompt. gpt-prompt-engineer is a tool that 
takes this experimentation to a whole new level.

Simply input a description of your task and some test cases, and the system will generate, 
test, and rank a multitude of prompts to find the ones that perform the best.
